## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.


## Installation
1. Clone the repo at `https://github.com/MikeNguyen1092/Answer_HACK`, 
2. Install the dependencies `npm install`,
3. Seed the database `npm run seed`,
4. Launch the App with `npm run dev`

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
